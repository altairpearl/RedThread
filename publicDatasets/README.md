After downloading the above listed files, unzip and untar them in this directory (RedThread/publicDatasets) so that the code in (RedThread/source) can locate it. If you wish to change the location to store the files, you will need to change RedThread/source/runScriptInputParameters.py so that the code is aware of the new location. See RedThread/source/README.md for more details.
