# RedThread
An active connection inference method for finding relevant and related entities to a given seed. 


You can use this algorithm to infer underlying connections in the data, given the evidences of connections, and the user's feedback in the loop. Possible use cases are finding advertisements posted by the same person in a classified advertising website, or discovering accounts being regulated by the same entity in social media.
